# Welcome to the Gemma Cookbook
This is a collection of guides and examples for [Google Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/).

> **Disclaimer:** Gemma is a family of developer-focused models built by Google Deepmind. This cookbook is a collection of guides and examples for Google Gemma. Please keep in mind that Gemma is an open model and can hallucinate as you build on examples in this cookbook.

## Get started with the Gemma models
Gemma is a family of lightweight, generative artificial intelligence (AI) open models, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. The Gemma model family includes:
* Gemma\
  The core models of the Gemma family.
  * [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card)\
    For a variety of text generation tasks and can be further tuned for specific use cases
  * [Gemma 2](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card_2)\
    Higher-performing and more efficient, available in 2B, 9B, 27B parameter sizes
  * [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card_3)\
    Longer context window and handling text and image input, available in 1B, 4B, 12B and 27B parameter sizes
  * [Gemma 3n](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/gemma-3n/model_card) \
    Designed for efficient execution on low-resource devices. Handling text, image, video, and audio input, available in E2B and E4B parameter sizes
* Gemma variants
  * [CodeGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/codegemma)\
    Fine-tuned for a variety of coding tasks
  * [PaliGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/model-card)\
    Vision Language Model\
    For a deeper analysis of images and provide useful insights
  * [PaliGemma 2](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/model-card-2)\
    VLM which incorporates the capabilities of the Gemma 2 models
  * [RecurrentGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/recurrentgemma)\
    Based on [Griffin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427) architecture\
    For a variety of text generation tasks
  * [ShieldGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/shieldgemma/model_card)\
    Fine-tuned for evaluating the safety of text prompt input and text output responses against a set of defined safety policies
  * [ShieldGemma 2](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/shieldgemma/model_card_2)\
    Fine-tuned on Gemma 3's 4B IT checkpoint for image safety classification
  * [DataGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/datagemma)\
    Fine-tuned for using Data Commons to address AI hallucinations
  * [MedGemma](https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations/medgemma)
    The MedGemma collection contains Google's most capable open models for medical text and image comprehension, built on Gemma 3. Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building healthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma comes in two variants: a 4B multimodal version and a 27B text-only version.

You can find the Gemma models on the Hugging Face Hub, Kaggle, Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Garden, and [ai.nvidia.com](https://ai.nvidia.com).
